It also supports vending STUN/TURN servers with the shared secret mechanism as described in this draft (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest-00). This mechanism is implemented e.g. by rfc-5766-turn-server (https://code.google.com/archive/p/rfc5766-turn-server/) or by a patched version (https://github.com/otalk/restund) of restund (http://www.creytiv.com/restund.html).
